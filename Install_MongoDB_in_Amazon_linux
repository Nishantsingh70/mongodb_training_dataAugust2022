Install MongoDB Community Edition

Follow these steps to install MongoDB Community Edition using the yum package manager. Select the tab for your version of Amazon Linux:

1) Configure the package management system (yum).

Create a /etc/yum.repos.d/mongodb-org-6.0.repo file so that you can install MongoDB directly using yum:

[mongodb-org-6.0]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/amazon/2/mongodb-org/6.0/x86_64/
gpgcheck=1
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc

You can also download the .rpm files directly from the MongoDB repository

. Downloads are organized by Amazon Linux version (e.g. 2), then MongoDB release version (e.g. 6.0), then architecture (e.g. x86_64).

Prior to MongoDB 5.0, odd-numbered MongoDB release versions, such as 4.3, were development releases. Beginning with MongoDB 5.1, MongoDB has quarterly rapid releases. For more information on the differences between rapid and long-term support releases, see MongoDB Versioning.


2) Install the MongoDB packages.

To install the latest stable version of MongoDB, issue the following command:

sudo yum install -y mongodb-org

Alternatively, to install a specific release of MongoDB, specify each component package individually and append the version number to the package name, as in the following example:

sudo yum install -y mongodb-org-6.0.1 mongodb-org-database-6.0.1 mongodb-org-server-6.0.1 mongodb-mongosh-6.0.1 mongodb-org-mongos-6.0.1 mongodb-org-tools-6.0.1

You can specify any available version of MongoDB. However yum upgrades the packages when a newer version becomes available. To prevent unintended upgrades, pin the package. To pin a package, add the following exclude directive to your /etc/yum.conf file:

exclude=mongodb-org,mongodb-org-database,mongodb-org-server,mongodb-mongosh,mongodb-org-mongos,mongodb-org-tools
